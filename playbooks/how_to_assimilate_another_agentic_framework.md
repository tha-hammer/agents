# Playbook: How to Assimilate Another Agentic Framework

*Status: Draft*

## Objective
Provide a repeatable, evidence-first workflow for studying similar or adjacent agentic projects, extracting transferable lessons across multiple layers (architecture, tools, prompts, workflows, documentation, and operational discipline), and proposing a safe, atomic integration plan for this project.

## Prerequisites
* Access to this repo and the comparison repo(s) (local paths, git URLs, or exported files).
* Ability to read documentation, prompts/instructions, playbooks, and implementation code from the comparison repo(s).
* A user-provided comparison repo (or a plan to provide one next).
* Time to perform deep reflection before proposing changes (do not jump straight to implementation).

## When to Use This Playbook
Use this playbook when:
* The user provides one or more other agentic frameworks/repos and wants lessons extracted.
* You need to improve this framework's reliability, accuracy, ergonomics, or extensibility using proven patterns from elsewhere.
* You need to decide whether to remain minimal or adopt more default playbooks/workflows.
* You want to compare not just code, but also prompt engineering style, tool design, and documentation policy.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Take a First Look at This Repo (Required, Before Asking for a Goal)**
    * Read `RULES.md`, `README.md`, and the current `./playbooks/*.md`.
    * Summarize the framework's apparent design philosophy by comparing and contrasting each of the key features to those of our framework.
    * Identify the current baseline posture:
        * Minimal-by-default vs batteries-included.
        * Strictness vs flexibility.
        * Documentation burden vs execution speed.
        * Atomicity vs expressiveness.
    * Do not begin by asking the user for an assimilation goal; present the user with a list of assimilation opportunities.

2.  **Create an Apparent Opportunity Map (Required)**
    * Based on the first look, define a set of apparent opportunities to explore and compare against other frameworks.
    * These are hypotheses, not conclusions.
    * Include opportunities across multiple layers, including:
        * Architecture and project organization.
        * Tool wrappers, tool usage, and execution/approval flow.
        * Playbook coverage (including whether more default playbooks would help or hurt).
        * Prompt engineering structure, tone, and timbre.
        * Documentation maintenance and self-evolving workflow policy.
        * Verification, debugging, and evidence collection discipline.
    * For each opportunity, state:
        * Why it appears to be a possible leverage point.
        * What outcome might improve if a better pattern exists elsewhere.

3.  **Define the Comparison Scope From the Opportunity Map**
    * Select which opportunities will be tested in this assimilation round.
    * Ask the user to confirm or reprioritize the opportunity list if needed.
    * Record explicit non-goals so the review does not sprawl.
    * Example non-goals:
        * Full architecture rewrite.
        * Blindly copying another project's prompt stack.
        * Adopting tooling patterns that conflict with this repo's safety model.

4.  **Collect Evidence From the Comparison Repo(s)**
    * Do not skim only the README.
    * Inspect the structure and the operating rules of the framework.
    * Gather evidence from the layers below:
        * Architecture and file organization.
        * Agent/system prompts, instruction style, and tone/timbre.
        * Tool wrappers and execution model.
        * Planning/approval workflow.
        * Documentation/playbook conventions.
        * Verification and debugging workflows.
        * Logging/observability guidance.
        * Git hygiene and commit practices (if present).
    * For each observed pattern, capture the source file/path and a short note on what problem it appears to solve.

5.  **Build a Multi-Layer Comparison Matrix**
    * Compare this repo and the other repo(s) across the same categories.
    * Required categories:
        * Architectural structure.
        * Agent constraints and policy design.
        * Planning and approval mechanics.
        * Tool interface design and failure handling.
        * Documentation maintenance model.
        * Playbook coverage (minimal vs default set).
        * Prompt tone/timbre and behavioral shaping.
        * Verification/debugging workflow quality.
    * For each category, explicitly state:
        * What they do better.
        * What we do better.
        * Unknowns / evidence gaps.

6.  **Deep Reflection (Required, No Fixes Yet)**
    * Reflect deeply before proposing any changes.
    * For each strong idea from another framework, answer:
        * What exact problem does it solve there?
        * What assumptions make it work there?
        * Do those assumptions hold here?
        * What is the smallest version of this idea that would help us?
        * What complexity cost would it add?
        * What failure mode could it introduce?
    * Reject cargo-cult adoption.
    * The goal is not to mimic another framework.
    * The goal is to graft lessons that improve this framework's outcomes while preserving its core philosophy (simple, straightforward, atomic, reliable across many agents).

7.  **Extract Candidate Lessons (Transferable vs Non-Transferable)**
    * Create two lists:
        * Transferable lessons (should adopt or pilot).
        * Non-transferable lessons (good ideas elsewhere, but not a fit here).
    * Required lesson types to consider:
        * Architecture-level patterns.
        * Tooling/execution patterns.
        * Playbook/workflow patterns.
        * Prompt engineering patterns (including tone/timbre and instruction layering).
        * Documentation and self-evolution patterns.
        * Small quality-of-life details that improve outcomes (naming, templates, examples, checklists, guardrails).

8.  **Run a Graftability Test for Each Candidate**
    * Score each candidate on:
        * Expected impact (reliability/capability gain).
        * Complexity cost.
        * Operational risk.
        * Reversibility.
        * Documentation burden.
        * Fit with this repo's design principles.
    * Mark each candidate as one of:
        * Adopt now.
        * Pilot first.
        * Defer.
        * Reject.
    * Prefer small reversible grafts over large architecture rewrites unless the user explicitly requests a redesign.

9.  **Evaluate the "Minimal vs More Default Playbooks" Tradeoff Explicitly**
    * Always evaluate both options:
        * Option A: Stay minimal (fewer default playbooks, stronger general rules).
        * Option B: Add more default playbooks (more explicit workflows, less ambiguity).
    * Analyze:
        * Reliability gains.
        * Maintenance cost.
        * Onboarding clarity for new agents.
        * Risk of over-constraining agents.
        * Risk of missing guidance for common tasks.
    * Recommend a threshold rule, such as:
        * Add a default playbook only when the task is common, high-risk, or multi-step enough to benefit from standardization.
        * Keep one-off or rapidly changing workflows out of the default set unless they recur.

10.  **Produce an Assimilation Report (Required Output)**
    * Deliver a structured report to the user containing:
        * First-look baseline summary of this repo.
        * Apparent Opportunity Map (the hypotheses chosen for comparison).
        * Repos reviewed and evidence sources.
        * Comparison matrix summary.
        * Top lessons learned (with rationale).
        * Non-transferable ideas (and why not).
        * Recommended grafts (ranked).
        * A concrete integration plan (atomic steps).
        * Risks and verification plan.
        * Documentation/playbook updates required.
    * The report must distinguish:
        * Observed facts (evidence from files).
        * Inferences (your reasoning).
        * Recommendations (proposed changes).

11.  **Propose an Atomic Integration Plan (Do Not Implement Yet)**
    * Break the recommended changes into small, reviewable tasks.
    * Include every file expected to change (`RULES.md`, `README.md`, playbooks, code/tools, templates, etc.).
    * If a new playbook is required, include it explicitly.
    * If prompt/instruction tone changes are proposed, identify where that wording lives and how behavior will be validated.
    * Ask clarifying questions for anything ambiguous.
    * Request explicit user approval before implementation.

12.  **Execute Only After Approval**
    * Implement the approved subset of changes.
    * Keep the changes atomic and aligned to the integration plan.
    * Do not silently broaden scope during implementation.
    * If new insights appear mid-change, pause and update the plan before proceeding.

13.  **Verify the Assimilation Outcome**
    * Verify at two levels:
        * Local correctness (files updated correctly, no broken references, docs consistent).
        * Workflow outcome quality (the new guidance actually improves clarity, reliability, or repeatability).
    * Where possible, test the new guidance with a small simulated task.
    * Report what improved, what remains uncertain, and what should be measured next.

14.  **Update Documentation and Playbooks (Self-Evolving Requirement)**
    * Update `README.md` if project organization, documented workflows, or user-facing usage changed.
    * Update `RULES.md` if operational policy, index requirements, or framework rules changed.
    * Update existing playbooks if the assimilation changed how common workflows should be executed.
    * Add a new playbook if the review exposed a recurring workflow that lacks one.
    * Document not only what changed, but why the change improves the framework.
    * Append today's journal repo work log entry for implemented repository changes.

15.  **Preserve an Assimilation Trail**
    * Record a short summary of:
        * Which external project(s) were studied.
        * Which lessons were adopted.
        * Which were rejected.
        * Why.
    * Store entries in `./docs/assimilations/` using `./templates/assimilation_trail_entry.md` and a date-first filename (`YYYY-MM-DD-framework-name.md`).
    * This prevents repeated re-analysis and helps future agents understand prior reasoning.

## Reflection Prompts (Use Verbosely Internally, Summarize Externally)
* What does the other framework solve that we have not encoded yet?
* Which details look cosmetic but actually enforce reliability?
* Which details look advanced but add more complexity than value for our goals?
* Are we missing a default playbook that would reduce repeated ambiguity?
* Would more default playbooks improve outcomes here, or create maintenance drag?
* Are we overfitting to one comparison repo's assumptions?
* What is the smallest graft that captures most of the benefit?

## Example Lessons to Look For (Non-Exhaustive)
* A better approval/escalation tool flow that reduces accidental unsafe actions.
* A better review protocol that prioritizes bugs/regressions before summaries.
* A stronger prompt tone/timbre that produces more direct, less ambiguous agent behavior.
* A clearer separation of plan mode vs execution mode.
* Better default playbooks for recurring tasks (debugging, code review, dependency upgrades, release steps).
* Better tooling implementation patterns (wrappers, tool ergonomics, failure reporting).
* Better documentation rules that reduce drift between code and policy.
* Better verification patterns (evidence-first checks, explicit line references, diff review discipline).
* Small wording changes in prompts that dramatically improve consistency across many agents.

## Anti-Patterns (Do Not Do This)
* Do not copy another framework wholesale because it "looks sophisticated."
* Do not confuse verbosity with reliability.
* Do not adopt patterns without identifying the problem they solve.
* Do not propose a large refactor when a small graft achieves most of the benefit.
* Do not skip documenting rejected ideas; rejections are part of the learning system.
* Do not implement before presenting the assimilation report and getting approval.

## Verification
* The assimilation report is evidence-based and cites concrete files/paths from reviewed repos.
* The proposed grafts are atomic, prioritized, and aligned with this framework's core philosophy.
* The plan clearly separates facts, inferences, and recommendations.
* Required documentation/playbook updates are identified before implementation.
* User approval is obtained before any code or policy changes are applied.

## Lifecycle Compliance
Confirm the workflow follows the required cycle:
Prompt -> Plan (based on a known playbook) -> Request approval -> Execute -> Plan/playbook update -> Docs update -> Verification.

If this occurs inside a git repo:
* Review `git status` and relevant diffs.
* Ensure today's journal repo work log is updated for implemented changes.
* Suggest a commit message that summarizes the completed task.
* Commit after approved checkpoint completion.
