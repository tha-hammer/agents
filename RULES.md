# Project Overview & Agent Guidelines

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: ALL AGENTS MUST READ THIS FILE (`RULES.md`) IN ITS ENTIRETY BEFORE PERFORMING ANY ACTIONS IN THIS REPOSITORY.

This document outlines the high-level architecture, development standards, and strict operational protocols for the project.

## 1. Documentation Integrity

**CRITICAL**: Any changes to code, features, or architecture MUST be simultaneously reflected in the project documentation. An agent's task is NOT complete until the documentation is consistent with the code.

When making *any* change, ALWAYS review and update the following files if they are affected by or relevant to the change:

1.  **`./README.md`** (Root): High-level design/project specs, roadmap, and submodule integration guidance.
2.  **`./RULES.md`**: Canonical organizational structure, policy, indexes, and operational protocols.
3.  **Root LLM shim files** (e.g., `./AGENTS.md`, `./GEMINI.md`, `./CLAUDE.md`, `./CODEX.md`, `./OPENCODE.md`) when bootstrap instructions change.
4.  **`./playbooks/*.md`**: Any standard operating procedures or workflows that may be altered by the change.
5.  **`./references/*.md`**: Reusable guidance patterns shared across multiple playbooks or prompts.
6.  **`./templates/*.md`**: Reusable output formats used to standardize agent results.
7.  **`./journal/*.md`** and **`./kanban/*.md`**: Daily operational artifacts and board state (when affected).
8.  **`./downtime/*.md`**, **`./downtime/reports/*`**, and **`./docs/assimilations/*`**: Maintenance task definitions, downtime reports, and the assimilation trail (when affected).
9.  **`./contexts/*.md`**: Behavioral mode profiles (when task-type behavioral guidance changes).

## 2. Operational Constraints (The Edge Protocol)

**CRITICAL**: ALWAYS assume you are running on a resource-constrained device.

Design decisions may have been made by larger models or humans with more context. Default to established patterns and incremental changes.

### The Reality
*   **Capacity**: Avoid deep architectural improvisation. Follow established procedures, interpret errors, and apply known patterns.
*   **Risk**: Attempts to improvise complex solutions without guidance will likely result in hallucinations, broken code, or "over-estimated capabilities."
*   **Role**: Your role is that of a precise, obedient operator, not a lead architect, unless explicitly asked.

### The Protocol
1.  **Seek Playbooks First** (REQUIRED): When presented with a task, your **first action** MUST be to search `./playbooks/` for a relevant guide.
2.  **Plan & Propose** (REQUIRED): After reviewing the appropriate playbook and BEFORE writing any code, you MUST:
    *   Formulate a **Comprehensive & Atomic Plan** detailing every file (code and documentation) that needs modification.
    *   Identify any missing information and ask **Clarifying Questions**.
    *   Present this plan to the user and **Explicitly Request Approval** to proceed.
3.  **Execute After Approval**: Once the user approves the plan, carry it out strictly according to the playbook. NEVER deviate from the approved plan without re-approval.
4.  **Wait for Long Operations (Synchronous Execution)**: When running build scripts, compilations, or deployments, ALWAYS execute synchronously and wait for completion before responding.
5.  **Stop on Ambiguity** (CRITICAL): If you cannot find a playbook describing exactly what you are trying to do:
    *   **STOP**.
    *   NEVER guess. NEVER try to "figure it out."
    *   **Report**: Inform the user: *"I do not have a playbook for [Task Name]. Please create a playbook for this task so I can execute it reliably."*

### Proactive Triggers
When you encounter these situations, ALWAYS take the specified action:
*   When you see a failing test → ALWAYS read the full error output before attempting a fix.
*   When you are about to modify a file → ALWAYS read the file first to understand current state.
*   When a plan step produces unexpected results → ALWAYS stop and report before continuing.
*   When you discover a file not listed in RULES.md indexes → ALWAYS flag it to the user.
*   When your context window is growing large → ALWAYS consider whether to summarize or compact before proceeding.

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER Do This)
*   NEVER improvise a complex solution when no playbook exists — stop and report instead.
*   NEVER skip the plan-and-propose step, even for changes that seem trivial.
*   NEVER modify files outside the scope of the approved plan without re-approval.
*   NEVER assume a previous agent's work is correct — verify before building on it.
*   NEVER silently broaden scope during execution; pause and update the plan first.

### Downtime Task Rule (Report-Only)

Downtime tasks are analysis-only. When executing any task in `./downtime/`:
* NEVER change framework files directly.
* Produce one report artifact in `./downtime/reports/pending/` that contains a comprehensive set of suggested changes.
* Name the report using the downtime task filename with `.report` inserted before `.md` (for example, `./downtime/x.md` -> `./downtime/reports/pending/x.report.md`).
* Wait for user review/approval before implementing any suggested changes from the report.

## 3. Self-Evolving Workflow (REQUIRED)

**CRITICAL**: This repository treats documentation and plans as executable policy. The system prompt lives in these files.

### Required Cycle
Prompt -> Plan (based on a known playbook) -> Request approval -> Execute -> Plan/playbook update -> Docs update -> Verification

If the work happens inside a git repo, ALWAYS extend the cycle with:
* Check `git status` and staged/untracked changes.
* Review the diff (staged or unstaged as appropriate).
* Suggest a commit message that summarizes the completed task.
* **First law of vibe coding**: commit after every approved completed checkpoint.

Note: "Commit after approved checkpoint completion" is an execution requirement, not a documentation requirement. Agents do not need to update `./README.md`, `./RULES.md`, or framework artifacts merely to record that a commit was performed, unless the workflow/policy itself changed.

### Definition of Done (DoD)
* Plan updated to match reality (if it changed mid-task).
* Playbook updated if the workflow was missing or wrong.
* Documentation updated to reflect all changes.
* Verification performed and reported.
* In git repos: status/diff reviewed and a commit message suggested; commit performed after approved checkpoint completion.

### Context Modes

When starting a task, select the behavioral mode that best matches the work type. Context mode files live in `./contexts/` and define distinct behavioral profiles:

* `./contexts/dev.md` — Action-first mode for building, fixing, and implementing. Bias toward code output over explanation.
* `./contexts/research.md` — Evidence-first mode for investigation, analysis, and learning. Bias toward breadth and accuracy over speed.
* `./contexts/review.md` — Severity-first mode for reviewing code, docs, and changes. Bias toward finding issues over summarizing.

When you recognize the task type, ALWAYS adopt the corresponding behavioral mode before proceeding. If the task spans multiple modes (e.g., research then implement), shift modes at the boundary.

### UI Intent
Commit history is a first-class UI surface. The user should see a list of recent completed tasks, so commit messages must be clear and task-scoped.

### Completion Summary Check (Required)
Before summarizing completed work to the user, check `./downtime/reports/pending/` for pending downtime reports (ignore the folder's `README.md`).
* If any pending report artifacts (excluding `README.md`) exist, explicitly tell the user that downtime reports are pending review and list their paths.
* If none exist, no special note is required.
After the completion summary is presented:
* Prompt the user to create or update today's journal entry with relevant checkpoint details (if needed).
* Prompt for commit/push action using the applicable playbook approval mode.

### Journal + Kanban Operational Policies

These policies govern daily journaling and kanban usage in this repository.

#### Journal Logging Requirement
* Any work that changes repository state must be logged in today's journal entry at `./journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
* Journal log entries should be append-only unless the user explicitly asks to edit prior text.
* The journal create/update prompt should occur after the completion summary and before commit/push execution.
* If non-journal repository changes are in scope and journal create/update is not approved, do not commit.

#### Journal Field Ownership Contract
* `Today's Intentions` and `Notes / Reflections` are user-only fields.
* Agents may only copy user-provided text verbatim into user-only fields.
* If user-only input is not provided, leave an empty list item (`-`).
* `Kickoff Context`, `Kanban State Summary`, and `Repo Work Log` are agent-managed fields.

#### Kanban Immutability Contract
* Kanban task lines are immutable user-authored data.
* Moving tasks must preserve exact line text byte-for-byte.
* Do not rephrase, normalize, merge, reorder, or clean up task text unless the user explicitly requests it.

#### Snapshot Commit Rule (Conversation Checkpoints)
* Commits represent completed conversation checkpoints, not completion of the broader plan.
* Before committing, present a clear snapshot summary.
* After summary, prompt to create/update today's journal entry with the checkpoint details.
* Explicit approval is required before commit unless staged scope is journal-only.
* Journal-only exception: if staged changes are only journal updates, commit/push may proceed without a commit approval prompt.

#### Journal Checkpoint Push-on-Commit Rule
* For approved journal checkpoint commits, push immediately after commit.
* Journal checkpoint commit/push behavior is governed by `./playbooks/how_to_commit_and_push_journal_checkpoints.md`.
* General git workflows remain governed by `./playbooks/how_to_commit_and_push_changes.md`.
* If a journal-only checkpoint is auto-committed, still push immediately and report the commit summary.

#### Startup Behavior
* On agent start, run the daily kickoff workflow in `./playbooks/how_to_run_daily_kickoff_and_capture_snapshot.md` when present.
* Startup kickoff begins with discovery only (read-only); do not write files before user approval.
* Proposed startup baseline artifacts:
  * `./journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
  * `./kanban/today.md`
  * `./kanban/this_week.md`
  * `./kanban/eventually.md`
  * `./kanban/ideas.md`
  * `./kanban/reminders.md`
* Present proposed creates/updates first, then request approval before any startup write.

## 4. Agent Playbooks (REQUIRED Index)

RULES.md MUST always include a complete list of all playbooks with their paths and a brief description. When a playbook is added, removed, or renamed, ALWAYS update this list in the same change.

## 5. Project Organization

The README MUST be updated when project organization changes in a way that affects the documented structure, submodule integration usage, or user-facing workflow guidance (for example, new top-level directories/files, renamed major folders, or changes to any structure explicitly listed in the README).

## 6. Logging & Debugging Standards
*   **REQUIRED**: The project must include comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities.
*   **Implementation**: Any new feature or module MUST include appropriate logging statements to facilitate troubleshooting and performance monitoring.
*   When you encounter an error during execution → ALWAYS capture the full error output as evidence before attempting a fix. NEVER discard error context.
