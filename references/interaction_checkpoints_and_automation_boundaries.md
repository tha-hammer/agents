# Reference: Interaction Checkpoints and Automation Boundaries

## Purpose

Define reusable rules for when an agent should:
- continue autonomously,
- ask the user a question,
- request approval,
- or stop due to ambiguity.

This reference is framework-level and should be applied by playbooks and prompts in a consistent way.

## Core Principle

Automate what is safe and knowable. Ask when approval, missing information, or ambiguity would materially affect correctness.

## Boundary Types

### 1. Execution Approval Boundary

Use when a change is about to be applied.

Examples:
- Editing files after analysis/planning
- Running a risky command
- Committing or pushing (unless already approved for that action, or a journal-only auto-commit policy exception applies)

Required behavior:
- Present the plan or the atomic action
- State impacted files/areas
- Ask for explicit approval if policy/playbook requires it

### 2. Information Gap Boundary

Use when the next step depends on information not available in the repo or prompt.

Examples:
- Missing target environment detail
- Choice between incompatible implementation paths
- Undefined user preference that affects output quality

Required behavior:
- Ask only the smallest question that unblocks progress
- Offer concrete options when possible

### 3. Ambiguity Stop Boundary

Use when no playbook exists for the requested task and the workflow would require guessing.

Required behavior:
- Stop
- State the missing playbook/workflow
- Ask the user to provide or approve a new playbook path

### 4. Safety / Permission Boundary

Use when a command requires elevated permissions or introduces risk.

Required behavior:
- Explain the purpose of the command
- Request approval through the proper mechanism
- Avoid broad escalation when a narrower one works

## Default Decision Rule

Before asking the user, check:
1. Can this be discovered locally?
2. Is it already specified by policy/playbook?
3. Is it reversible and low risk?
4. Would guessing likely reduce correctness?

If (1) or (2) is yes, do not ask.
If (4) is yes and the answer materially changes execution, ask.

## Approval Language Pattern

Good:
- "Proposed changes: X, Y, Z. Files: A, B, C. Approve this patch?"
- "I need one choice to continue: option A or B for [reason]."

Bad:
- "What do you want me to do?"
- "Should I continue?" (without scope)

## Progress Update Pattern

Use short updates while working:
- What you are doing now
- Why it matters to the task
- What you learned (if relevant)

Avoid:
- Long internal monologue
- Repeating the same status with no new information

## Anti-Patterns

- Asking for approval after the change is already made
- Asking broad open-ended questions when a narrow choice would do
- Treating every minor step as a checkpoint
- Continuing through ambiguity because "it probably means X"
- Asking users to perform automatable low-risk steps
